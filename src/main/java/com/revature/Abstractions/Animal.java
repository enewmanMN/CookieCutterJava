    Abstract classes

        - Cannot be directly instantiated (cannot use the new keyword), must
            have a concrete implementation by means of one or more subclasses
                + all abstract methods in the class MUST be implemented by concrete subclasses

        - Still have constructors, because subclasses will leverage these for their own
            instantiation.

        - Can have zero or more abstract methods contained within its declaration.
            + abstract methods are simply methods that do not have any implementation, also
                called "method stubs";
